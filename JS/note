In JavaScript the three most common types of data types are:
    - numbers 90
    - strings '90', ""
    - Boolean (True or False)

A variable is a way to store information so that you can use and manipulate it



Two-step process:
   - declare the variable - (let , var and const)
   - name the variable
//const n2 ;// error
// const n1 = 3.14 (MUST BE initialize);



var can be redeclare and reinitialize 
let cannot be redeclare but can be reinitialize
const  cannot be redeclare and reinitialize  

// operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:

String Opertor .
Aritmetic Operators .
Assignment Operators .
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
Conditional Operators 
Type Operators



 - The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.


 - The addition operator (+) adds numbers:
 - The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
 - The Devission operator (*) Devission numbers.
 - The Substraction operator (*) Substraction numbers.
 - The Module( Division Remainder) operator (%) Remainder numbers.
 - The Increment And Decrement. 

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use ` if ` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

- Use ` else ` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false

- Use ` else if ` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

- Use ` switch ` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


----------------------------
 
Comparison Operators
 
-- Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

-- Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result.

---------------------------
Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

 JavaScript Loops
    - For Loop 
    - While Loop
    - Do While Loop


JavaScript Array
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

.. Array Methods 

push() – add one or more elements to the end of an array.
unshift() – add one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
pop() – remove an element from the end of an array.
shift() – remove the first element from an array.
splice() – manipulate elements in an array such as deleting, inserting, and replacing elements.
sort() - the  sort order is ascending
reverse() -  the first array element now becoming the last, and the last array element becoming the first.


A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Anonymous Function
It is a function that does not have any name associated with it. Normally we use the function keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript, however, in anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function keyword without the function name


-- Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax

The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.




<!-- DOM Munipulation -->

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page


DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
 DOM(Document Object Model) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content,


Add Event Listener DOM Event Types
Mouse Events: click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, contextmenu, mouseout, mousewheel, mouseover, mousemove , mouseleave.

Touch Events: touchstart, touchend, touchmove, touchcancel.

Keyboard Events: keydown, keyup, keypress.

Form Events: focus, blur, change, submit.


 function validateEmail(email) 
    {
        var re = /^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+)*)|(\".+\"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
        return re.test(email);
    }
